config CLUSTER_PLUG
        bool "Enable cluster-plug cpu hotplug driver"
        default n
        help
          CPU hotplug driver designed for ARM big.LITTLE systems where
          both the big and little CPUs are of the same type. On these
          systems, it preferable to normall use the big cluster, and
          only activate the little cluster for highly parallel loads.
          This hotplug implementation always keeps the big cluster
          online, and only activates the little cluster for heavy
          parallel loads.

config MSM_HOTPLUG
	bool "MSM hotplug driver"
	depends on HOTPLUG_CPU
	default n
	help
	  The MSM hotplug driver controls on-/offlining of additional cores based on current cpu load.

config BRICKED_HOTPLUG
 	bool "Enable kernel based mpdecision"
 	depends on MSM_RUN_QUEUE_STATS
 	default n
 	help
 	  This enables kernel based multi core control.

	help
	  Automatically hotplugs the multiple cpu cores on and off based on cpu load and suspend state

config THUNDERPLUG_CONTROL
 	bool "Enable plugging down/up of cores using powersuspend"
	default n
 	help
 	  This driver uses powersuspend to take down the cpu cores on a octa core device.

 	  Mako Hotplug: A custom hotplug by fransico franco

config MSM_RUN_QUEUE_STATS
	bool "Enable collection and exporting of MSM Run Queue stats to userspace"
	default n
	help
	This option enables the driver to periodically collecting the statistics
	of kernel run queue information and calculate the load of the system.
	This information is exported to usespace via sysfs entries and userspace
	algorithms uses info and decide when to turn on/off the cpu cores.
